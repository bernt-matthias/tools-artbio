# Creation of 2 datasets for test
 - dataset1 :1K of the first sequences bellow 10Kb length in vir2 query
 - dataset2 :10K of the first sequences bellow 10Kb length in vir2 query

# launched test in each dataset with command

 - dataset1 : Runtime = 1h16 - number of centroids = 410
 - dataset2 : Runtime = 11h2 - number of centroids = 4 775

# checked insidence in time on dataset1 of adding "--usersort" option to the command
 => No insidence detected (Dataset1 may be too small to detect insidence)

# Problem detected : centroids file doesn't end with new line

# Check if big difference in length distribution (Just curiosity doesn't have anything to do with quality of clustering)
